In this section I have done my website on Bloody Sunday a Historic event that happened in Nothern Ireland. It goal is to inform you off what happened during Bloody Sunday, and to how long it has still been going on without an answer or result.


I have added a feature for the logo to zomm in once the screen has loaded up.

I've my nav bar fully responsive loading to all pages and back with easy navigation. I have set it up so that it should be easy to navigate through any device you are on if it be a phone, tablet or PC.

I've added a footer linking to all social networks to were you can find information about this event on anywhere be it on twitter or on youtube.


In the Gallery page I added a few photos showing you images of what it was like back then.

I had added an image into the center of the html page to split up the text as it looked like it was just too much to read in one go.


Testing Phase:
I had tested it out and it the responsiveness of the page is nice and fast as well as the first image zooming in is smooth. All links to social medias work in the footer as well as the navigation links.

Credits:

Go to the help of Code instute with there CSS and HTML code as well as W3 schools for some snytax errors I made to fix. 
Would also like to thank the BBC news website for the information on Bloody Friday as well as Wikipedia.

Features I would have loved to impliment would be a form to give the people viewing the website ideas of what they would want next. What article or what time period of history would they want the website or a website based with more funcality as well as it being more appealing.

Please see below my link to the project.
